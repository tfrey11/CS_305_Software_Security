# CS_305_Software_Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?

  The client Artemis Financial, is a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. These plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. The issue they wanted to address was modernizing their operations with custom       software, with a focus on security due to the fact that they handle highly sensitive information.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?

  Something I did very well would be identifying security vulnerabilities and communicating these vulnerabilities to the client in an easily understandable way. It is important to code securely to ensure that your code is as protected from attacks as possible
  this will make it easier in the end to evaluate and secure any vulnerabilities in the end product. Software security adds value in the knowledge that a company is as protected as possible from an attack.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

  The part of the vulnerability assessment that was most challenging to me was learning what vulnerabilities to supress and what ones were actually a threat.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

  To increase layers of security I added input validation to all methods that take input, implemented user authentication and authorization, and implemented query parameteruzation to ensure database security.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

  To ensure that the code was indeed functional I ran the code and tested manually. To ensure that the code was secure I used the vulenerability assessment tool to check for any new vulnerabilities introduced. These are both great resources to know for future projects and   work


Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

  One of the things I would show from this project would be using the vulnerability assessment tool successfully to mitigate any known security vulnerabilities.
